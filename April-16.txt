problem:1
============

"Print all perfect numbers between 1 to 100.

Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
For example: 6 is the first perfect number
Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3
Sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Hence 6 is a perfect number."

problem:2
============
"Find the median of two sorted arrays of different size. 

Example:
 Input : 
Array 1: 2 3 6 7 9 
Array 2: -1 4 8 10  = 5 

Output : 6

Hint: The final sorted array would be - 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 The 5th element of this array is 6.
